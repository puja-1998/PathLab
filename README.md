Pathlab

Pathlab is an advanced pathfinding and data analysis platform designed to solve complex routing and mapping problems. Whether you're working with medical pathways, geographic information systems (GIS), or logistics, Pathlab provides a fast, accurate, and efficient way to analyze and optimize paths in various domains.

Features

Pathfinding Algorithms: Implements common algorithms like Dijkstra, A*, and BFS for optimal routing.

Interactive Visualization: Provides a dynamic map to visualize paths and results in real-time.

Multiple Domain Support: Suitable for medical, geographic, and logistics-related applications.

Data Integration: Allows integration with multiple data sources for customized pathfinding scenarios.

Real-Time Processing: Optimized for real-time data processing and feedback.


Installation

Follow the steps below to set up Pathlab on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed before proceeding:

Node.js (for backend services, if applicable)

Python (for machine learning or data analysis components, if applicable)

Database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB, depending on your project's needs)

Additional tools like Docker (if used for containerization)

Installing

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathlab.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd pathlab
3. Install dependencies:

For Node.js backend:
npm install

For Python backend:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up the database (if required): Follow the database setup guide in docs/database-setup.md for detailed instructions on how to configure and initialize the database.

5. Configuration:

Set up environment variables by creating a .env file in the project root with the necessary keys (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

Usage

Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application locally:

For the Node.js backend, use:
npm start

For Python backend, run:
python app.py

This will start the server locally, and you can begin interacting with the platform.

Accessing the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the appropriate port configured for your application) to access the Pathlab interface.

Example Usage

You can input your pathfinding data into the system's UI (like a map or grid) and execute the pathfinding algorithms. The results will be displayed in real-time on the map.

Command-Line Interface (CLI)

If Pathlab has a CLI tool for advanced configurations or automated tasks, you can run commands like:
pathlab analyze --source pointA --destination pointB

This will trigger the analysis and output the best path between the source and destination points.

Contributing

We welcome contributions to Pathlab! If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
3. Make your changes and commit them (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
4. Push the changes to your fork (git push origin feature-branch).
5. Open a Pull Request on the main repository.


Acknowledgements
